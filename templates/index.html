			<h3>Lea-Ann Belter</h3>
<p>Canadian designer Lea-Ann Belter’s style can be summed up in two words: modern and timeless. While these two words may seem contradictory, Belter has been able to infuse them deep into the seams of her designs. She’s been the creative type ever since she was a little girl, but didn’t realize that she would be designing wedding dresses until she hand-crafted a gown for her sister-in-law. Her flawless style caught on when she launched the Lea-Ann Belter Bridal line, and she’s been designing classic wedding dresses ever since.

			<h3> Blakely </h3>
<p> We had such a fabulous time working with Blakely to find her dream wedding gown! She knew she wanted something timeless and elegant with a detailed twist, and this Lela Rose gown she chose was the total package!
"My favorite parts were the laser detail and the ruffle on the back," said Blakely. "I think this gown was the perfect mix of my classic, traditional side with a little flare!"
The bride elected to wait to see her father until the moment before he walked her down the aisle, and the expression on his face [pictured below] says it all! He looks thrilled to see his daughter looking absolutely stunning in her wedding gown!
Congratulations, Blakely, you were a positively radiant bride!!!</p>

			<h3>Lea-Ann Belter</h3>
<p>We had the pleasure of working with this sweet bride, Madeline, to find her perfect wedding gown.
"It was important to me that my dress matched the look and feel of our venue," said Madeline. "This gown was absolutely perfect for our Savannah wedding at The Mansion on Forsyth Park - romantic, distinctive, elegant and timeless."</p>
                 
                 <p>It was all about the details for the stunning design Madeline chose. </p>

<p>"The hand-embroidered organza overlay was so intricate, delicate and unlike anything I had ever seen," she said. "I loved the off-the shoulder illusion neckline, low back and trumpet silhouette. It was perfect!"
Congratulations, Madeline! You were such a beautiful bride!</p>
