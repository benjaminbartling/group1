<p>Adriana Alier by Rosa Clará is an affordable, timeless option for any bride. These chic, traditional style dresses are sure to please all soon-to-be brides.

<h3>LEA-ANN BELTER</h3>
<p>Canadian designer Lea-Ann Belter’s style can be summed up in two words: modern and timeless. While these two words may seem contradictory, Belter has been able to infuse them deep into the seams of her designs. She’s been the creative type ever since she was a little girl, but didn’t realize that she would be designing wedding dresses until she hand-crafted a gown for her sister-in-law. Her flawless style caught on when she launched the Lea-Ann Belter Bridal line, and she’s been designing classic wedding dresses ever since.

<h3> Shopping Tips </h3>
<dl>
<dt> Schedule an Appointment </dt>
<dd> When you schedule an appointment you will have a personal bridal stylist and one of our spacious Dressing Room Suites for your family and friends. Your personal bridal stylist will be able to answer any questions about customizing our wedding dresses because most all can be customized</dd>
<dt> It's True </dt>
<dd> The time it takes to make a wedding dress is anywhere from 4-6 months, depending on the designer and the dress. You should begin shopping for your wedding dress a minimum of 8 months in advance of the wedding to allow enough time for alterations once the wedding gown arrives. But don't worry if you didn't get to start that far in advance, there is always an option to expedite your wedding dress for a small fee.</dd>
<dt> Set a Budget </dt>
<dd>Know the amount of your wedding budget you would like to go towards your wedding dress. It is vital to know this before shopping so that you don't risk falling in love with something that is out of your budget (That's not fun for anyone).</dd>
<dt> Get To Know your Bridal Style </dt>
<dd>Do a little research by looking through magazines, browsing our designer's websites, blogs, and Pin, Pin, Pin. We love it when girls bring in their private Pinterest Board!</dd>
<dt> Who to Bring </dt>
<dd>That is up to you but we suggest you keep in mind that whoever you bring with you is going to give their opinion. Make sure it is an opinion that you want.</dd><br>
<dt> Help Us Help You </dt>
<dd> We want you to have the wedding dress of your dreams. So, bring in pictures of styles that you love. This will help us find you the perfect wedding gown. During the appointment if you love a wedding dress but just wish one thing was different, ask your bridal stylist. Most anything can be done to customize a wedding dress.</dd>
<dt> Relax and have Fun </dt>

<dt> Blakely </dt>
<dd> We had such a fabulous time working with Blakely to find her dream wedding gown! She knew she wanted something timeless and elegant with a detailed twist, and this Lela Rose gown she chose was the total package!
"My favorite parts were the laser detail and the ruffle on the back," said Blakely. "I think this gown was the perfect mix of my classic, traditional side with a little flare!"
The bride elected to wait to see her father until the moment before he walked her down the aisle, and the expression on his face [pictured below] says it all! He looks thrilled to see his daughter looking absolutely stunning in her wedding gown!
Congratulations, Blakely, you were a positively radiant bride!!!</dd>

<dt> Catherine </dt>
<dd> We had such a wonderful experience working with Catherine to find her perfect Monique Lhuillier gown! Being a dancer, Catherine wanted to incorporate her professional passion into her bridal portraits and the results are absolutely STUNNING! The pointe shoes are such a classically beautiful touch. We love a bride who embraces her personal style, and Catherine was all smiles and sparkles on her big day! Plus, check out how flawlessly she's working that bold red lip!
Congratulations, Catherine, you were such an exquisite bride!!!</dd>
<dt>Madeline</dt>
<dd>We had the pleasure of working with this sweet bride, Madeline, to find her perfect wedding gown.
"It was important to me that my dress matched the look and feel of our venue," said Madeline. "This gown was absolutely perfect for our Savannah wedding at The Mansion on Forsyth Park - romantic, distinctive, elegant and timeless."
It was all about the details for the stunning design Madeline chose. 
"The hand-embroidered organza overlay was so intricate, delicate and unlike anything I had ever seen," she said. "I loved the off-the shoulder illusion neckline, low back and trumpet silhouette. It was perfect!"
Congratulations, Madeline! You were such a beautiful bride!</dd>
