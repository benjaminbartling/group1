			<h3>Lea-Ann Belter</h3>
<p>Canadian designer Lea-Ann Belter’s style can be summed up in two words: modern and timeless. While these two words may seem contradictory, Belter has been able to infuse them deep into the seams of her designs. She’s been the creative type ever since she was a little girl, but didn’t realize that she would be designing wedding dresses until she hand-crafted a gown for her sister-in-law. Her flawless style caught on when she launched the Lea-Ann Belter Bridal line, and she’s been designing classic wedding dresses ever since.
